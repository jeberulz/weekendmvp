# WP71 Progress - AI gateway, prompt registry and evals harness

## 2026-11-05 - Setup

- Branch/worktree: `claude/wp71-ai-gateway` in `.worktrees/wp71-ai-gateway`, from `main` at `d67dc8e2`.
  G0 closed when #175 merged, and the owner gave the go for Phase 1.
- Assignment: WP71 (`04`), Claude lane, high.
- File boundaries are listed in `wp71-stories.md`. Metering is Codex's (WP70); until it merges, the gateway
  uses a stub with the C-METER signatures.
- Required checks: typecheck, lint, test, build.
- D23 ruled 2026-11-05 (owner: "Approve D23"): no model tool loops; S2 is unblocked.
- Needs from Codex: the optional env entries in `.env.example` (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`,
  `RECRAFT_API_KEY`, `RECRAFT_STYLE_ID`, `AI_PROVIDER_MODE`), already requested as WP69 ask 8.
