# WP62 Progress - Builder's Hub Billing (Subscriptions, Annual And Founding Lifetime)

> Renumbered from WP55 on 2026-10-07 (see `docs/wp/RULINGS.md`): a local Codex branch,
> `codex/wp55-price-acceptance`, already uses WP55. Entries dated before this note keep
> the old WP55 label and the old `wp55-*` file names. Read them as WP62.

Append-only progress log. Do not rely on chat history for project state. Treat this file as claims, not evidence. Verify before relying on a number.

## 2026-10-04 - Setup

- Branch/worktree: planning docs only, on `claude/tender-heisenberg-bf94ku`, fast-forwarded to `origin/main` at `f22590e` before writing (the branch had no commits of its own). No build branch exists. No worktree.
- Assignment: the owner asked for a strategy and pricing review of the paid plan, then approved a price ladder and asked for it to become a work package. This session wrote the plan. It wrote no code.
- File boundaries: this session touched only `docs/wp/RULINGS.md` (six rows appended), `docs/PROJECT_STRATEGY.md` (one registry row), `docs/wp/wp55-stories.md`, `docs/wp/wp55-progress.md` and `docs/wp/evidence/wp55-pricing-and-billing-research.md`.
- Required checks for this docs-only change: `git diff --check`, ruling rows have five cells, referenced paths exist, no secret and no audience numbers in the public repo.
- Initial risks:
  1. A merge to `main` deploys the live Convex backend before the Next build (`scripts/vercel-build.mjs`). Billing code must ship dormant.
  2. Stripe Managed Payments covers UK-based sellers but limits itself to "fully automated" digital products. The approved monthly live build may disqualify the plan, which would make Managed Payments unsafe (O1).
  3. The live ship·able webhook acts on every Checkout Session completed event on the account. A membership checkout would enroll the buyer in the workshop emails until S1 lands.
  4. `payments.recordEvent` and `subscriptions.record` are public mutations. Neither table can be trusted for eligibility.
  5. There is no audience baseline. Members and buyers are zero, so launch depends on the newsletter list and the first live build.
  6. The first-day quiet period would hide the offer from people who sign up because of an offer email (O6).
  7. The E7 editorial launch is using the same production pipeline. Do not merge WP55 during an E7 GO step.

## 2026-10-04 - WP55-S0

- Actions taken:
  - Read the WP44 PRD, the rulings log, the WP24 billing code and stories, the legacy webhook, the plan and entitlement code, the dashboard offer code, the Convex guidelines and the current handoff.
  - Compared the plan against Design+Code (read from the site's own code), Stripe's pricing page and Managed Payments docs, GOV.UK, and search summaries for other products. Two research agents were interrupted by the owner. Their search results were read from the saved transcripts. No agent report was used as a conclusion.
  - Checked which WP numbers exist on `main`: WP45, WP46 and WP54 are in use. WP47 to WP53 appear only as a reservation text. WP55 is unused.
  - Appended six rulings, reserved the registry row, and froze the stories, contract, data model and open decisions.
- Decisions made (all in `docs/wp/RULINGS.md`, 2026-10-04): the number WP55 (owner delegated), the price ladder, the live build in the bundle, the offer order, the 30-day refund, and UK as the seller location. The offer lives inside the dashboard. Hosted Checkout is a design choice in the frozen contract and is reversible. The owner's phrase "embedded in the dashboard" was read as the offer surfaces, not Stripe's embedded Checkout. If that was not the intent, say so before S3.
- Checks run: ruling rows each have five cells. The registry row has six cells and sits inside its table. `git diff --check` is run before the commit (see the next entry).
- Result: S0 done. Open decisions O1 to O9 remain, each with a recommended default and a decider.
- Gotchas:
  - The fetch tool said `designcode.io`, `stripe.com`, `docs.stripe.com` and `gov.uk` were blocked after the owner opened network access. The session proxy allowed them, and curl through it worked. Both facts are recorded in the evidence file.
  - The earlier chat breakdown contained two errors, corrected in the evidence file: conflicting churn figures, and a dispute fee that left out the $15 countered fee.
  - Primary and secondary labels in the evidence file are the source of truth for how much to trust a number.
- Next: owner rulings on O1 to O9, starting with a written answer from Stripe on the live build (O1). Then S1 (legacy isolation) and S2 (schema and resolver), which can start once the owner opens the build lane and names a branch. S1 needs no open decision.

## Owner follow-ups

- Ask Stripe in writing whether Builder's Hub (software features plus one live group build a month with replays) qualifies for Managed Payments. Also ask whether Billing's 0.7% applies and how the Customer Portal works with Managed Payments subscriptions.
- Confirm the seller's legal form, registered address and VAT status (O2). Take O1 and O3 to an accountant and a lawyer.
- Confirm that WP55 is not already planned inside the unseen "membership program" (WP47 to WP53). If it is, renumber with a new ruling.
- Say whether "embedded in the dashboard" meant the offer surfaces (assumed) or Stripe's embedded Checkout.
- Decide the live build slot and logistics (O8) and schedule the first session before window 1.

## 2026-10-07 - Renumber and sync

- Actions taken:
  - Merged `origin/main` (57 then 65 commits behind, merge commit `8bb15b1`). Two docs conflicts (the rulings log and the registry) were resolved by keeping both sides. No code conflicts.
  - Renumbered the package from WP55 to WP62. WP62 is used nowhere on `main` or on any remote branch (highest in use: WP61). Renamed the stories, progress and evidence files. Moved the registry row after WP61. Appended the ruling "WP62 / renumbering". Left the six 2026-10-04 rulings untouched.
  - Added "Changes on main since planning" to the stories (WP57 account gate and Beehiiv sync, busy seams, S1 unchanged).
- Decisions made: none new. The renumber follows the owner's instruction of 2026-10-07.
- Checks run:
  - Baseline of `main` at `09ef90e` in a throwaway worktree (since removed): `npm run typecheck` passed. Test stages passed for links, redirects, auth, security, sitemap, Convex (490), engine (1,076), home, prompts and platform. Six tests failed in this sandbox: three OG-image tests that call OpenAI and Recraft (hosts blocked here, so environmental) and three editorial tests ("headers was called outside a request scope", not diagnosed, unrelated to billing). Lint and the build were not run. The baseline predates the last merge of `main`.
  - `git diff --check` on the docs passes. It flags blank lines at the end of two files that came from `main` (`components/public/IdeaCards.tsx`, `components/public/Sections.tsx`), which are not part of this work.
- Result: branch is in sync with `main` and carries only docs. No Stripe code exists yet.
- Gotchas:
  - A registry row on a side branch does not protect a number. Other sessions only see rows on `main`. The row reserves WP62 for real once it is merged to `main`.
  - Local-only branches are invisible from a cloud checkout. If one already uses WP62, renumber again the same way.
- Next: unchanged. Owner rulings on O1 to O9, starting with Stripe's written answer on the live build. S1 and S2 can start once the owner opens the build lane, names a branch, and confirms no other package holds the schema writer slot.
