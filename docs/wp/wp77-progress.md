# WP77 Progress - Wren chat and the approvals loop

## 2026-11-06 - Started (Phase 2)

- G1 passed (`d8055b98`); the owner said "Merged, go Phase 2".
- Branch and worktree: `claude/wp77-wren-approvals` at `.worktrees/wp77-wren-approvals`, from `d8055b98`.
- Order: S1 first, because Codex's WP78 publisher and WP79 sender call `assertApproved`.
- Needs from Codex: none yet.

## 2026-11-06 - S1

What: C-APPROVAL. Generators and Codex's flows raise cards with the internal `createApproval`. The founder lists
pending cards and approves, asks for changes (optional note) or cancels them. Stale pending cards expire, and
`assertApproved` gates every send, post, publish, ad launch and spend.

Files:
- `convex/workspace/approvals.ts`: `createApproval` (internal) + `createApprovalRecord` helper,
  `listPendingApprovals` (public query), `decideApproval` (public mutation), `expireStaleApprovals` (internal,
  cron target), `assertApproved(ctx, approvalId, subject)` helper + `checkApproved` (internal query for actions),
  exported validators and `ApprovalSubjectRef`.
- `lib/workspace/contracts/approvals.ts`: kinds, statuses, decisions, the closed kind → subject-table map,
  version policy, TTL and limits, error codes (types and pure helpers only).
- `convex/workspace/approvals.test.ts`: 16 convex-test cases.
- `convex/_generated/api.d.ts`: registered the new module (the same two lines codegen writes; no deployment touched).

Decisions:
- Subject shape `{ projectId, kind, subjectTable, subjectId, ownerId? }`. Each kind can name only certain tables:
  publish → `site_versions`; send → `sequences` | `sequence_steps` | `outbound_messages`; post → `social_posts`;
  ad_launch → `ad_campaigns`; artifact_review → `documents` | `site_versions`; spend → `documents` | `tasks`;
  upgrade → `projects`.
- Version: `approvals` has no version column. The strongest check the schema allows is that the subject row and
  the content it carries were written no later than the approval's `createdAt`. That content is the site
  version's document, a sequence's steps and their documents, a post or message's document, and an outbound
  message's list. A `site_versions` row is immutable (WP28 inserts new rows), so its id is the version. `projects`
  (upgrade) is checked by identity only. If a subject row links to a different `approvalId`, the check refuses.
  Gap: a status-only patch on a mutable workflow row also counts as a change, so the check fails closed. Callers
  must call `assertApproved` before they patch the subject. They must also write the subject's `approvalId` link
  in the same mutation as `createApproval`.
- Exactly once: repeating the same decision is a no-op (`changed: false`). Any other decision on a decided card
  throws `APPROVAL_ALREADY_DECIDED`. An approve whose subject changed throws `APPROVAL_SUBJECT_CHANGED` and leaves
  the card pending. Raising the card again cancels the stale one. A card past its 7-day TTL becomes `expired` on
  decision.
- `assertApproved` also refuses when the kind's kill switch is on: publish → `publish`, send → `email`,
  post → `social`, ad_launch → `ads`. It never consumes the approval. Exactly-once delivery is the caller's
  idempotency key.
- Expiry runs while the workspace is off, because closing stale cards only removes permission (the same reasoning
  as the C-METER shutdown-cleanup ruling). Each transaction handles one bounded page (default 50, max 100), and the
  function schedules the next page itself. It is idempotent.
- Decisions on send/post/publish/spend/ad_launch/upgrade write an `audit_events` row (`02` §4.1).

Tests (`npx vitest run convex/workspace/approvals.test.ts`, 16 passed): create → list → approve →
assertApproved (query and mutation contexts); dedupe and supersede on creation; creation refusals; double decide
is exactly once with one audit row; request-changes note trimmed and length-capped; approve refuses a changed
subject; TTL expiry on decide; pending, cancelled and changes_requested give NOT_APPROVED; wrong kind, project,
owner, forged owner, other subject, wrong table, missing approval and archived business all fail closed; changed
version for document, site-version document, added sequence step and ad budget; deleted subject; a link to
another approval; non-owner, other business and signed-out callers cannot list or decide; workspace off refuses
list, decide, create and assert; the kind's kill switch; expiry is bounded, finishes the table, is idempotent and
runs while off. A mutation test (disabling the version check and the same-decision no-op) turned 2 cases red, and
both were restored.

Checks: `npm run typecheck` 0; `npx tsc --noEmit -p convex` 0; `npm run lint` 0 (0 errors, 37 existing warnings,
none in new files); `npm run test:security` 0 (the WP68 guard scanner accepts the new public functions);
`npm test` 1 on the first run (editorial fixture `beforeAll` hook timeouts under load; `npm run test:editorial`
alone passed 295/295), then 0 on a full rerun.

Docs: progress and stories updated; contract file documents the API. No plan or ruling changes.

Needs from Codex:
1. `convex/schema/workspace.ts` `approvals`: add `subjectVersion: v.optional(v.string())`, a content fingerprint
   written at creation, so status-only patches stop invalidating approvals. After it lands, Claude switches
   `assertApproved` to fingerprint comparison.
2. `approvals` index `by_status_and_createdAt` (`["status", "createdAt"]`) so expiry reads only pending rows
   instead of paging the whole table.
3. `convex/crons.ts`: `crons.interval("expire stale approvals", { hours: 1 },
   internal.workspace.approvals.expireStaleApprovals, {})`.
4. WP78/WP79/WP83: call `assertApproved` in the side-effect mutation, before patching the subject, with the
   subject shape above; from actions, use `internal.workspace.approvals.checkApproved` and re-check in the
   recording mutation.
