# WP90 Progress - Research-driven idea seeds

Append-only progress log. Do not rely on chat history for project state.

## 2026-11-07 - Setup

- Branch/worktree: `claude/wp90-idea-seeds` in `.worktrees/wp90-idea-seeds`, from `origin/main` at `9557593e`. The root checkout holds other sessions' uncommitted work, so this WP runs in its own worktree.
- Assignment: owner request, 2026-11-07: build the full research-driven seed feature properly, even if L1 moves.
- File boundaries: see `docs/wp/wp90-stories.md` per story.
- Required checks: `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `npm test`, `npm run build`; a11y-check on changed wizard screens; `scripts/check-prompt-versions.mjs`.
- Initial risks:
  - The Message Batches submit/poll path does not exist yet (`anthropic.ts` notes it as S5 work). Metering already supports `batch: true` reservations.
  - No research records exist in the repo for the 231 public ideas: the MDX page and the manifest row are the seed source.
  - `convex/schema/workspace.ts` has one writer per merge window.
  - New prompt versions must keep the lock check green.
