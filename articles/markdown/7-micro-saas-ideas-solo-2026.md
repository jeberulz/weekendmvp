# 7 Micro-SaaS Ideas You Can Build Solo in 2026

No co-founder. No funding. Just you, AI tools, and a weekend.

---

The micro-SaaS market is projected to grow from $15.7 billion to $59.6 billion by 2030. That's 30% growth every year.

But here's what most people miss: you don't need to be the next Slack or Notion. A successful micro-SaaS might make $5,000 to $30,000 in monthly recurring revenue. For a solo founder, that's life-changing money.

The focused scope means you can build and launch in 4 to 12 weeks rather than 6 to 24 months. With AI tools like Cursor and Bolt, some people are shipping MVPs in days.

Here are 7 ideas you can start building this weekend. Each one is specific, validated by market data, and sized right for a solo founder.

## 1. AI Meeting Notes Cleaner
**Revenue:** $29-99/month per user

**The Problem**
After every meeting, people spend 15-30 minutes cleaning up messy transcripts from Zoom, Google Meet, or Otter.ai. Action items are buried. Key decisions are scattered. It's tedious work that nobody wants to do.

**The Solution**
A simple web app: paste your messy transcript, click a button, get back a clean summary with extracted action items, key decisions, and attendee notes. Three screens total.

**Why It Works**
The AI meeting assistants market is projected to grow from $3.24 billion in 2025 to $7.33 billion by 2035. Remote and hybrid work aren't going anywhere. People will pay to save 15 minutes per meeting.

## 2. Vertical CRM for One Niche
**Revenue:** $49-199/month per user

**The Problem**
Generic CRMs like HubSpot or Salesforce are built for everyone, which means they're optimized for no one. A landscaper doesn't need the same features as a real estate agent. They end up paying for complexity they don't use.

**The Solution**
Build a CRM for one specific industry: personal trainers, wedding photographers, pool cleaners, tutors. Include only the features they actually need. Speak their language.

**Why It Works**
Vertical SaaS consistently outperforms horizontal tools. When someone searches "CRM for landscapers" and finds a tool built exactly for them, they'll pay a premium. The customization and relevance make businesses more willing to pay monthly.

## 3. AI Content Repurposer
**Revenue:** $19-79/month per user

**The Problem**
Creators and marketers write one blog post, then manually rewrite it as LinkedIn posts, Twitter threads, newsletter intros, and YouTube scripts. It takes hours. Most people skip it entirely, leaving distribution on the table.

**The Solution**
Paste a blog post URL or text. Get back 5+ formatted variations: LinkedIn carousel, Twitter thread, email newsletter section, YouTube script outline, and Instagram caption. One click, multiple outputs.

**Why It Works**
AI content creation is expected to grow 21.9% annually, reaching $7.74 billion by 2029. The "create once, distribute everywhere" workflow is becoming standard. People will pay to save 2 hours per piece of content.

## 4. Subscription Analytics Dashboard
**Revenue:** $29-149/month per business

**The Problem**
Small businesses using Stripe have basic metrics, but no easy way to see MRR trends, churn predictions, or cohort analysis without expensive tools like Baremetrics or ChartMogul ($50-500/month).

**The Solution**
A lightweight Stripe analytics tool for indie hackers and small SaaS. Connect with one click, see the 5 metrics that matter: MRR, churn rate, LTV, growth rate, and trial conversion. No bloat.

**Why It Works**
Analytics dashboards generate consistent revenue because they solve ongoing operational problems. Every SaaS founder checks their metrics daily. Price it at $29/month and you're 10x cheaper than the big players.

## 5. AI Cold Email Generator
**Revenue:** $39-99/month per user

**The Problem**
Freelancers, agencies, and sales reps send hundreds of cold emails. Writing personalized emails that don't sound like spam takes forever. Generic templates get ignored. Response rates tank.

**The Solution**
Input the prospect's LinkedIn URL or company website. The AI researches them and generates a personalized opening line, relevant value prop, and clear CTA. No more "I hope this email finds you well."

**Why It Works**
AI-powered proposal and outreach tools for consultants and agencies are one of the fastest-growing micro-SaaS categories. People who send cold emails send a lot of them. Monthly recurring revenue follows naturally.

## 6. E-commerce Returns Manager
**Revenue:** $49-199/month per store

**The Problem**
Small Shopify and WooCommerce stores handle returns manually: email threads, spreadsheets, lost refund requests. It's messy, slow, and customers get frustrated. Enterprise solutions cost $500+/month.

**The Solution**
A simple returns portal for small stores. Customers submit returns through a branded page. Store owners see all requests in one dashboard. Automatic status updates via email. Starting at $49/month for stores handling up to 100 returns.

**Why It Works**
E-commerce returns management for platforms like Shopify and WooCommerce is a proven micro-SaaS category. Volume-based pricing scales with the customer. As their store grows, they pay more. Natural expansion revenue.

---

## 7. Niche Booking Tool
**Revenue:** $19-79/month per business

**The Problem**
Calendly is great for generic meetings. But tutors need to track subjects and student levels. Pet groomers need to capture pet type, size, and special instructions. Music teachers need to handle recurring lessons with makeups. Generic tools don't fit.

**The Solution**
A booking tool built for one profession. "Scheduling for music teachers" or "Booking for mobile dog groomers." Include the specific fields they need. Integrate with the tools they already use.

**Why It Works**
Vertical scheduling tools command higher prices than generic alternatives. When someone sees "built for tutors" instead of "built for everyone," they trust it more. Niche markets are easier to reach and easier to dominate.

## The Reality Check

Here's something most "idea lists" won't tell you: 70% of micro-SaaS businesses generate under $1,000 per month. Only 1-2% exceed $50,000 per month.

Plan for 12-18 months to reach meaningful revenue. The ideas above aren't get-rich-quick schemes. They're real business opportunities that require execution.

The good news? Most founders in 2025-26 report spending under $1,000 before first revenue, thanks to free tiers on modern development tools. The barrier to entry has never been lower. The only question is whether you'll start.

## How to Validate Before Building

Don't build for 3 months then launch to crickets. Validate first:

- **Landing page test:** Create a simple landing page and drive targeted traffic. 20+ qualified email signups indicates genuine interest.
- **Problem interviews:** Talk to 10-20 potential customers. Focus on past behavior, not hypothetical futures. "Have you tried to solve this?" beats "Would you pay for this?"
- **Beta commitment:** Offer beta access at a discount. Measure who actually commits to paying. Credit cards on file beat verbal interest.

The strongest validation: when someone asks "how much and when can I buy it?" before you've even finished explaining.

---

## TL;DR

- Micro-SaaS market growing 30% annually ($15.7B to $59.6B by 2030)
- Success = $5K-$30K MRR, not billion-dollar unicorn
- Best ideas: AI tools, vertical SaaS, and niche solutions for specific industries
- Build and launch in 4-12 weeks with AI tools, not 6-24 months
- Validate before building. 20+ signups or paid beta commits.
