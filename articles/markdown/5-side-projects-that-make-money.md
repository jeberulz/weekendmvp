# 5 Side Projects That Actually Make Money

From people who built them. With real numbers.

---

The internet is flooded with "100 side hustle ideas" articles written by people who've never made a dollar from any of them.

This isn't that.

These are five side projects that are actually generating revenue in 2026—with real numbers, real examples, and a realistic view of what it takes to make them work.

One in four Americans now has a side hustle. Freelancers generated **$1.5 trillion in earnings** in 2024 alone. The average American freelancer makes around $99,000 a year. The opportunity is real. The question is: which side project is right for you?

## 1. Digital Products (Templates, eBooks, Courses)

**Income potential:** $500–$10K per month
**Profit margins:** 70–90%

**What it is:** Creating and selling digital products like Notion templates, design templates, eBooks, planners, or online courses. You create once, sell forever.

**Real numbers:** According to Teachable, the average online course earns about $3,000. But here's the real story: even average creators with 3-5 solid templates can hit $500-1,000/month passively. A well-positioned niche eBook can generate $200-500/month for years. Digital planners alone can generate around $45,000 per year once created.

**Why it works:** No manufacturing. No shipping. No inventory. Your biggest cost is your time creating the first version. After that, each sale is almost pure profit. The digital goods market passed $124 billion in 2025 and is projected to hit $920 billion by 2033.

**Weekend MVP angle:** Start with a single template or guide solving a specific problem. You don't need a course empire—you need one product that sells consistently.

## 2. UGC Creation (User-Generated Content)

**Income potential:** $150–$300 per video (average), $5K–$10K+ monthly (top earners)

**What it is:** Creating authentic-looking video content for brands—product reviews, unboxings, testimonials, how-to videos. You don't need a following. Brands hire you to create content they use in their ads.

**Real numbers:** The average UGC creator charges $195 per piece of content in 2026. Rates range from $150 to $300 for most creators, with top creators commanding $100 to $2,500 for a 60-second video. Glassdoor reports UGC creators average $101,313 per year, with the top 10% making over $185,000.

**Why it works:** Brands have realized that polished ads don't convert like authentic content. They need real people making real-looking videos. The barrier to entry is low—you need a phone, decent lighting, and the ability to be natural on camera.

**Weekend MVP angle:** Create 3-5 sample videos for products you already own. Build a simple portfolio page. Apply to 10 brands in one niche. You can start earning within a week.

## 3. AI Automation Services

**Income potential:** $60–$150 per hour, $2K–$15K per project

**What it is:** Building AI-powered automations for businesses using tools like Make, Zapier, n8n, and AI APIs. You automate repetitive tasks: email responses, data entry, customer service, lead qualification, content creation workflows.

**Real numbers:** Average project value ranges from $2,000 to $15,000, with recurring revenue potential of $500-2,000/month per client for maintenance and updates. AI-powered SEO services alone can generate $500 to $15,000 per month. Beginners often earn $500-1,000/month, while skilled practitioners make $3,000-8,000/month.

**Why it works:** AI-powered side hustles have seen a 28% rise in interest. Most businesses know they should be using AI but don't know how. You bridge that gap. And once you build an automation, clients often need ongoing support—creating recurring revenue.

**Weekend MVP angle:** Learn one automation tool deeply (Make or n8n). Build 3 sample automations. Reach out to 20 local businesses with a specific offer: "I'll automate your [specific task] and save you 10 hours/week."

## 4. No-Code Development

**Income potential:** $50–$120 per hour, $1K–$5K per project

**What it is:** Building websites, apps, and internal tools for businesses using no-code platforms like Webflow, Bubble, Framer, or AI tools like Bolt.new and Cursor. You solve real business problems without writing traditional code.

**Real numbers:** Many no-code developers charge $1,000-5,000 per project, which often works out to $50-120/hour for part-time work. This is highlighted as a consistent money maker, especially for small businesses that can't afford full engineering teams.

**Why it works:** Small businesses need digital tools but can't afford $50,000 for custom development. You offer a middle ground: professional results at a fraction of the cost. And with AI-powered tools like Bolt.new, you can build faster than ever.

**Weekend MVP angle:** Pick one platform (Webflow for sites, Bubble for apps). Build 2-3 demo projects. Specialize in one industry (e.g., "Webflow sites for fitness studios"). Being specific beats being generic.

## 5. Content Production (Podcasts, YouTube)

**Income potential:** $500–$2K per month (1K-5K audience), $50K+ monthly (scaled)

**What it is:** Creating podcasts, YouTube channels (including faceless channels), or offering production services to others. This includes editing, show notes, content repurposing, and full production management.

**Real numbers:** Ginni Saraswati-Cook turned her podcast side hustle into a production agency generating $50,000 in monthly revenue. Podcasters with 1,000-5,000 dedicated listeners make $500-2,000 per month through ads or sponsors. Faceless YouTube channels using AI tools can generate passive income once established.

**Why it works:** Content is still king, but most creators don't have time to produce and edit. The service side (podcast editing, YouTube production) offers faster income than building your own audience. And if you do build an audience, it becomes a platform for selling anything else.

**Weekend MVP angle:** Two paths: (1) Start a niche podcast where you interview people in your target industry—it builds relationships AND content. (2) Offer podcast editing services to 5 existing podcasters at a below-market rate to build your portfolio.

## Which One Is Right for You?

- **Want passive income?** → Digital Products. Create once, sell forever. But requires upfront time investment.
- **Comfortable on camera?** → UGC Creation. Low barrier to entry, fast to start earning. Limited by your time.
- **Like solving problems with tech?** → AI Automation or No-Code. Higher rates, recurring revenue potential. Requires learning tools.
- **Have domain expertise?** → Content Production. Build an audience in your niche. Slower start, but compounds over time.

The best side project is the one you'll actually do. Pick one. Give it 90 days. Then decide if it's working.

## The Real Secret Nobody Talks About

None of these will make you rich overnight.

But here's what the research shows: the goal isn't one massive income stream. It's building a portfolio of 5-10 streams, each earning $500-2,000/month. That creates real financial freedom.

Start with one. Master it. Then stack another.

The people making real money from side projects aren't the ones with the best ideas. They're the ones who actually shipped something.

---

## TL;DR

- **Digital Products:** $500-$10K/month, 70-90% margins, passive once created
- **UGC Creation:** $150-300/video, fast start, no following needed
- **AI Automation:** $60-150/hr, $2K-15K per project, recurring revenue
- **No-Code Development:** $50-120/hr, $1K-5K per project, high demand
- **Content Production:** $500-2K/month base, scales to $50K+ with audience

## Stop researching. Start building.

Pick an idea. Give it a weekend. Ship something.
