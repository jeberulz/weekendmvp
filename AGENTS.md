<!-- convex-ai-start -->

This project uses [Convex](https://convex.dev) as its backend.

When working on Convex code, **always read
`convex/_generated/ai/guidelines.md` first** for important guidelines on
how to correctly use Convex APIs and patterns. The file contains rules that
override what you may have learned about Convex from training data.

Convex agent skills for common tasks can be installed by running
`npx convex ai-files install`.

<!-- BEGIN:agentic-delivery-workflow -->
This repo uses the agentic delivery workflow.

Before coding, read:
- `AGENTS.workflow.md`
- `.agentic-workflow.yml`
- `docs/wp/RULINGS.md`

Required defaults:
- Choose Program/Migration, Work Package, Small Fix, or Gate lane before editing.
- For large/risky programs, audit first, freeze `docs/wp/program-manifest.md`, sequence by risk, and gate every wave.
- Create/switch to a branch before story or code changes.
- For work packages, maintain `docs/wp/wpNN-stories.md` and `docs/wp/wpNN-progress.md`.
- Use Git worktrees only when needed, and only under `.worktrees/`.
- Never create sibling project folders for work packages.
- Use sub-agents only for parallel work packages, independent review, gate runs, or context isolation.
- Route model quality by risk: high for orchestration/security/architecture/data/AI/final review, mid for standard WPs, low for scaffolding/docs/checks/mechanical fixes.
- Run the configured checks and record docs updated/not needed.
